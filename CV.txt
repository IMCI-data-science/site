RESEARCH INTERESTS
Humanitarian Supply Chain mapping in post-conflict setting	
Pending Publication 	Data Collection Partner: Various Lebanese NGOs
This study investigates the structure of agricultural supply chains in post-conflict Lebanon. Using qualitative interview data collected from local NGOs, we formulated a generalized humanitarian supply chain model adapted from commercial supply chain theory. The framework aims to enhance understanding of how post-conflict agricultural systems re-emerge and to inform the design of more resilient and effective humanitarian logistics interventions.
Disease mapping and outbreak prediction in South-East Asia	
Actively seeking academic collaboration	Data Collection Partner: Singapore Red Cross
This project aims to develop a predictive modeling framework to forecast the severity and spread of disease outbreaks across South-East Asia. Leveraging existing quantitative datasets from public health and environmental sources, the study integrates statistical and machine learning approaches to identify key drivers of outbreaks. The resulting model is intended to support humanitarian organizations in resource allocation for health emergencies.
Fundraising Prediction Modeling for NGO and Charity	
Actively seeking academic collaboration 	Data Collection Partner: Singapore Red Cross
This research seeks to develop a data-driven predictive model to estimate the success of fundraising campaigns within the Singapore nonprofit sector. Using historical fundraising data, the study applies classification techniques to identify the key determinants of donor engagement and campaign performance. The resulting insights aim to enhance evidence-based decision-making for NGOs.
